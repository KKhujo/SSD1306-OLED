<h1>Using the <em>SSD1306-OLED</em> to display a bitmap image.</h1>
Resolution is 128Ã—64 pixels, so you will need to edit your image prior to getting its encoding. 
The bitmap tool I made is not that extensive but does its role.
<br>`g++ bitmap.cpp -o bit -lfreeimage` when compiling on Arch. Other systems usual process...probably.
